Snaggle is an OAuth 1 Client Library that can be used to generate signatures and
the appropriate OAuth 1 Headers. While OAuth 2.0 is suggested for building a new API, there are still plenty of popular services that use OAuth 1.0. 
## Installation

Snaggle should be installed via composer:
```
"require": {
    "mfrost503/snaggle": "1.0.0"
}
```

### OAuth 1.0 Client Examples
OAuth 1.0 requires the use of Access and Consumer tokens, being able to create a valid signature will unlock the content of an OAuth 1.0 APi.

```php
use Snaggle\OAuth1\Client\Credentials\AccessCredentials;
use Snaggle\OAuth1\Client\Credentials\ConsumerCredentials;
use Snaggle\OAuth1\Client\Signatures\HmacSha1;
use Snaggle\OAuth1\Client\Signatures\Plaintext;
use Snaggle\OAuth1\Client\Header\Header;

// first we need to represent our tokens, these should be stored securely
$consumer = new ConsumerCredentials('CONSUMER_KEY', 'CONSUMER_SECRET');

$access = new AccessCredentials('ACCESS_TOKEN', 'ACCESS_SECRET');

$signature = new HmacSha1($consumer, $access)
    ->setResourceURL('https://api.example.com/v1/users')
    ->setHttpMethod('get');

$header = new Header();
$header->setSignature($signature);
$header->createAuthorizationHeader();
```

There's also a plaintext signature type (which should only be used when there is no other way and over https), it implements the signature interface and uses the signature parent, so it's use is the same as HmacSha1, only the instantiation differs
```php
$signature = new Plaintext($consumer, $access);
```
This line can be used interchangeably with the signature instantiation in the previous example.

## Signatures

This library has an implementation of HMAC-SHA1 and Plaintext signatures, these
signatures are used to communicate the identity of the resource owner making the
request. Services can have different requirements for how a signature is built,
the signatures in this library are built to the OAuth 1.0 spec.

### HMAC-SHA1

HMAC-SHA1 is the more secure of the two signature types in this library and is
the most commonly used. This signature involves the creation of a base string
and composite key that are encapsulate and hash the information required to
identify with an OAuth 1.0 service.

### Plaintext

Plaintext signatures should only be used over https, because they aren't secure.
Services like Twitter don't allow you to use the Plaintext signature, but they
can be very handy if you are working with an internal API and the complexity of
a signature doesn't provide a real strong security benefit.



## HTTP Client

Snaggle does not come with an HTTP client included in the library, the reason
for that is there are HTTP Clients that are very well done, but everyone's needs
and access to these tools maybe different. Those clients do a great job at the
job they're meant to do, which is make HTTP requests. Snaggle's role in this
process is to provide the headers that are required to make OAuth 1 requests
work properly and handing those off to whatever client you choose to use.

There are a couple different cases when it comes to providing headers to
clients. For example, when setting a header in cURL you'll have to send the
```'Authorization: '``` prefix, but with Guzzle you'll just want the content of
the headers. Snaggle gives you the option to generate the headers with or
without the prefix. Below is an example of each using Guzzle and cURL:

### Guzzle

In Guzzle, we don't want the prefix so the
``` $header->creationAuthorizationHeader()``` has a parameter ```
$includePrefix``` that is set to false by default. So here's how you'd use it
with a client that doesn't need the header prefix.
 
```php
$header = new Header();
$header->setSignature($signature);
$authorizationHeader = $header->createAuthorizationHeader();

$client = new Guzzle\HttpClient();
$client->get('https://api.example.com/v1/users', [
	'headers' => ['Authorization' => $authorizationHeader]
]);
```

### cURL

cURL will require the prefix when adding the header to the request. In order to
do this, we'll just need to pass the parameter ```true``` to the ```
$header->createAuthorizationHeader();```

```php
$header = new Header();
$header->setSignature($signature);
$authorizationHeader = $header->createAuthorizationHeader(true);

$ch = curl_init('https://api.example.com/v1/users');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [$authorizationHeader]);
```

By using this approach, we can decouple the generation of the OAuth 1 Headers
from the HTTP Client that will eventually be used to send the requests.

## Making token requests

One of the more challenging aspects to understand is the token exchange, which is
necessary for communicating with a resource server. Essentially there are a number 
different times where some back and forth communication needs to happen. Here's an
example of how you could use this library to retrieve an access token from Twitter.

```php
use \Snaggle\Client\Credentials\ConsumerCredentials;
use \Snaggle\Client\Credentials\AccessCredentials;
use \Snaggle\Client\Signatures\HmacSha1;
use \Snaggle\Client\Header\Header;

$consumer = new ConsumerCredentials('CONSUMER KEY', 'CONSUMER_SECRET');
$access = new AccessCredentials();
if (!isset($_GET['oauth_token']) && !isset($_GET['oauth_verifier'])) {

    $signature = new HmacSha1($consumer, $access);
    $signature->setResourceURL('https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token')
              ->setHttpMethod('post');

    $headers = new Header();
    $headers->setSignature($signature);
    $auth = $headers->createAuthorizationHeader();

    $client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
    $response = $client->post('https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token', [
        'headers' => ['Authorization' => $auth]
    ]);
   
    $res = $response->getBody();
    parse_str($res);
    header('Location: https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=' . $oauth_token);

} else if(isset($_GET['oauth_token']) && isset($_GET['oauth_verifier'])) {
    $access->setIdentifier($_GET['oauth_token']);
    $signature = new HmacSha1($consumer, $access);
    $signature->setHttpMethod('post')
              ->setResourceURL('https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token');

    $headers = new Header();
    $headers->setSignature($signature);
    $auth = $headers->createAuthorizationHeader();

    $client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
    $response = $client->post('https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token', [
        'headers' => ['Authorization' => $auth],
        'body' => ['oauth_verifier' => $_GET['oauth_verifier']]
    ]);

    $res = $response->getBody();

    // parse_str will create variables called $oauth_token and $oauth_token_secret
    parse_str($res);
	$access->setIdentifier($oauth_token);
	$access->setSecret($oauth_token_secret);

	// You will need to persist these values at this point
}
```

## Notes

OAuth 1.0 can be a little bit difficult to wrap your head around when you first
look at it, the aim of this library to encapsulate a lot of that confusion and
provide a simple interface for making OAuth 1.0 calls. The OAuth 1.0 RFC was the
standard that was kept in mind when building this library, though I feel that I
should point out, not every service that calls itself an OAuth 1.0 service
follows this standard.

This library works best with APIs that make an attempt to closely adhere to the
Signature standards in the OAuth 1.0 specification, which unfortunately means
that this may not work with every API that calls itself an OAuth 1.0. That
doesn't mean that we've given up on those completely, it just means that as we
become aware of them we'll have to analyze whether or not it's in the best
interest of this project to accommodate various divergences from the OAuth 1.0
standard. Pull Requests are always welcome.
